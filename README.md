# Predictive-Modeling-of-Disease-Outcomes-Using-Chaos-Theory
This repository explores the application of chaos theory in predicting disease outcomes. By leveraging machine learning models combined with chaotic system dynamics, this project aims to identify complex patterns in medical data that traditional models may overlook.
