Predictive Modeling of Disease Outcomes Using Chaos Theory

Overview
This project applies chaos theory to the prediction of disease outcomes using machine learning models. Traditional approaches often struggle with the inherent unpredictability in biological systems. By leveraging the principles of chaos theory, this project aims to uncover hidden patterns in medical data, offering more accurate and insightful predictions.

Features
1) Chaotic System Modeling: Integration of chaos theory to model the complex and seemingly random behavior in disease progression.
2) Advanced Machine Learning: Utilization of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict disease outcomes.
3) Data Visualization: Tools for visualizing chaotic patterns and prediction results.
4) Custom Case Studies: Examples of real-world medical datasets and the application of chaos theory to improve prediction accuracy.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1) Python 3.x
2) Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
3) Git.
