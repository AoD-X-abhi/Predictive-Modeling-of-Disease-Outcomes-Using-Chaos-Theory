# Predictive-Modeling-of-Disease-Outcomes-Using-Chaos-Theory
This repository explores the application of chaos theory in predicting disease outcomes. By leveraging machine learning models combined with chaotic system dynamics, this project aims to identify complex patterns in medical data that traditional models may overlook.

Key Features:
Chaotic System Integration: Application of chaos theory to model the unpredictable behavior in disease progression.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of advanced algorithms to predict disease outcomes based on chaotic patterns.
Data Analysis: Analysis of medical datasets to uncover hidden correlations and dynamics.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing the chaotic behavior and prediction results.
Case Studies: Example cases demonstrating the effectiveness of chaos theory in disease prediction.
Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras
Chaos Theory Algorithms
Data Science Libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Objective:
To enhance the accuracy of disease outcome predictions by integrating the principles of chaos theory with modern machine learning techniques.
